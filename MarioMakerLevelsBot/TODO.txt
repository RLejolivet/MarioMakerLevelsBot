Things left to do:

- Make the window remember various settings (checkbox states, size)

- Make saved and fake lists save to files

- Check if a level is in the fake list when creating it (new "add fakes model" to the model)

- Allow channel change if hitting "connecting" again

- Improve the README.md

- Make a webpage with images/video (?)

- Add a "select random" button

- Make an icon (?)
