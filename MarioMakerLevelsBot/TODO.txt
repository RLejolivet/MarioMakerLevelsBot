Things left to do:

- Make the window remember various settings (checkbox states, size)

- Make models for saved levels and fake levels (possibly with less info, and/or with a "note")

- Check if a level is in the fake list when creating it

- Improve the README.md

- Make a setup.py to freeze with cx_freeze

- Make a webpage with images/video (?)

- Add a "select random" button
